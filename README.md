# Dashed Border Generator
A simple online tool for creating custom dashed or dotted borders. Using CSS hack, this tool can simply increase space between dots, change dash length or distance between strokes.

## How does it work? ðŸš€
Native CSS properties **don't support** the customization of `border-style`. 
Therefore, we use a trick with an ***SVG image inside*** `background-image` property. 
The SVG features give us the ability to change the distance between dashed lines, set custom pattern, add dash offset or even change a line cap. 

Generated SVG image is vector and it fills width and height of elements by 100%, so it doesn't matter what size elements have.
